# Smol

A tiny language with tiny memory footprint for human size **prototyping**.
- immutable, purely functional. Inbuilt data structures for set, map, list. Because `smol`.
- Forces normal form. Only variables can occur at binding sites. Because `smol`.
- Only small types allowed: A type may have at most `4096` inhabitants.
- All data is represented with succinct data structures. Can do for `smol`.
- Debugger which keeps a trace of the entire history of the program.
  Can do this because `smol`.
- Common lisp-like REPL interface that permits hot reloading. Maintains
  history across reloads. Is possible because `smol`.
- Can exhaustively check invariants about function spaces. Because `smol`.
